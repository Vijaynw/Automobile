      <p class="w3-large">When you think of the very first car created, what do you imagine? Cars made out of tree branches with stone wheels, powered by Fred Flintstone’s feet? A quaint little buggy with thin, oversized tires, driven by a man wearing a top hat? What did the very first cars look like, and how have they changed over the years? They’re probably a little different than you’d think!

While some of the very first cars were powered by steam engines, dating back to the 1700’s, it was Karl Benz in 1885 who invented the first gas-powered car, which he later received a patent for in 1886. Benz’s first car had three wheels, looked much like an elongated tricycle, and sat two people. Four-wheeled gas-powered cars were later introduced in 1891. The invention of the gas-powered automobile marked the beginning of the evolution.
